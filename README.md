- 👋 Hi, I’m @bakeshakes
- 👀 I am new to the site.  I have had all the apple products (except newton) that they have made.
- 🌱 I am planning on running OpenCore on my Late 2013 27" iMac.
- 💞️ I’m looking to see if anyone has tried OpenCore on a Late 2007 MacBook 13" - Identifier  MacBook 3,1  Intel Core 2 Duo?  The current list stops at 2008.
- I am currently running Snow Lepord as that was the last OS for this model. The trusty MacBook is now a sound machine on our night stand.  It would be fun
- to bring it back to life.
- 📫 I can be reached at steven5824@icloud.com
